# objectOrientedPractice

Java is an object-oriented high-level programming language. Classes and objects are the core of Java program.
Around Java classes and Java objects, there are three basic features: encapsulation is a Java class writing specification, inheritance is a form of class-to-class association, and polymorphism provides a solution for decoupling between system components or modules.
